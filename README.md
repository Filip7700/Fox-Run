# Fox Run - Self Thaught AI

Fox Run is a game demo which uses AI to teach itself how to 
get as many points as possible in game by using method of 
reinforcement learning.
The game is designed and programmed in Unity using 
C# programming language.
The game's mechanics is based on well known Google Chrome's game 
"T-Rex Run".
In order the game plays itself successfully, the AI needs to control 
the games main hero (Foxy) to jump at the right time and just enough high 
to avoid running into obstacles.
For every successfully avoided obstacle (successfully jumped over it), 
Foxy get 1 point for reward.
Otherwise, Foxy get punished by taking away 3 points.
